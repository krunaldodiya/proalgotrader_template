Yes, we can achieve this by modifying the code-server command in our entrypoint script to open the README.md file in preview mode when the IDE starts. Let's update the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile:Dockerfile
# Use the latest Python image
FROM python:latest

[previous content remains the same...]

# Create entrypoint script with host binding and README preview
RUN echo '#!/bin/bash\n\
source /workspace/setup.sh\n\
source /tmp/project_env\n\
code-server --bind-addr "0.0.0.0:8080" --auth password "$PROJECT_PATH" --open-readme' > /workspace/entrypoint.sh && \
chmod +x /workspace/entrypoint.sh

# Start code-server with the project directory
CMD ["/workspace/entrypoint.sh"]
```
However, I notice that the `--open-readme` flag isn't actually a valid code-server option. Let's use a different approach by creating a custom settings file that will automatically open README.md in preview mode:

```dockerfile:Dockerfile
# Use the latest Python image
FROM python:latest

[previous content remains the same...]

# Create workspace directory
RUN mkdir -p /workspace

# Copy setup script
COPY setup.sh /workspace/setup.sh
RUN chmod +x /workspace/setup.sh && \
    chown $USER:$USER /workspace/setup.sh

# Set up working directory
WORKDIR /workspace

# Switch to the non-root user
USER $USER

# Create projects directory with correct permissions
RUN mkdir -p $HOME/projects && \
    chmod 755 $HOME/projects && \
    # Create VSCode settings directory
    mkdir -p $HOME/.local/share/code-server/User

# Add VSCode settings to auto-open README
RUN echo '{\n\
    "workbench.startupEditor": "none",\n\
    "workbench.editorAssociations": {\n\
        "README.md": "vscode.markdown.preview"\n\
    }\n\
}' > $HOME/.local/share/code-server/User/settings.json

# Expose the code-server port
EXPOSE 8080

# Create entrypoint script with host binding
RUN echo '#!/bin/bash\n\
source /workspace/setup.sh\n\
source /tmp/project_env\n\
code-server --bind-addr "0.0.0.0:8080" --auth password "$PROJECT_PATH" && \
sleep 2 && \
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/files" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\\"file\\": \\"README.md\\"}"' > /workspace/entrypoint.sh && \
chmod +x /workspace/entrypoint.sh

# Start code-server with the project directory
CMD ["/workspace/entrypoint.sh"]
```
I've made two key changes:

1. Added VSCode settings that:
   - Disable the default welcome screen
   - Associate README.md files with the markdown preview by default

2. Modified the entrypoint script to:
   - Start code-server normally
   - Wait for it to be ready
   - Open README.md automatically

Now when users first access the IDE:
1. The welcome screen will be disabled
2. README.md will automatically open in preview mode
3. Users will immediately see the documentation

Let me know if you'd like me to make any adjustments to this setup!
